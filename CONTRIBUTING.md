### Coding Conventions

.editorconfig is great, but very limited in options

I propose an [ESlint](https://eslint.org/) config for javascript
and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for spacing, semicolons, etc.

There's a standard config, plus Google and Airbnb have good ones, but you can of course set your own preferences.  Being able to use these would make contributing 10x easier.

There's also [prettier-eslint](https://github.com/prettier/prettier-eslint).

And since docs are open source:
Any voice or tone that you want to maintain?
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brand_language

I'm not sure it's relevant here, but if there any situations where design language might come into play, that would also be helpful.

### How Can I Contribute?

I've seen a lot of projects using "Help Wanted" and "Beginner" tags for issues.  Seems like a good idea.

[Atom has a good CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) (exhaustive though).  Some good ideas in there.

[Github's support page](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-guidelines-for-repository-contributors/).  Helpful links at the bottom.
